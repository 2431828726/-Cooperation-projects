            <!-- Article content -->
            <p>During an earthquake, indoor spaces are where we often stay, so building earthquake safety awareness is crucial. Firstly, understand the dangers of earthquakes and potential impacts, including damage to the structure of buildings, collapsing of items, and the possibility of fires. Secondly, learn how to respond correctly to earthquakes, including staying calm, adopting protective postures, and evacuating in the right way. Additionally, establish a family earthquake emergency plan, specifying evacuation routes, designated shelters, and emergency contacts, to respond quickly and orderly in the event of an earthquake.</p>

            <p>Before an earthquake occurs, taking some indoor safety precautions can reduce the harm caused by earthquakes. Firstly, ensure that the structure and decoration of the home comply with safety standards, such as reinforcing building structures and installing earthquake-resistant equipment. Secondly, avoid placing too many heavy items indoors, secure furniture and other items to the walls to reduce the risk of collapse and injury. Also, regularly inspect the safety of facilities such as wiring, gas pipes, and water pipes, and ensure that firefighting equipment, emergency lighting, and first aid tools are in good condition.</p>
            <img src="zijiu4-2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
            <p>When an earthquake occurs, correct indoor evacuation techniques can significantly increase the chances of survival and escape. Firstly, quickly find the safest refuge, such as under a table, in a corner, or near load-bearing walls, and protect your head and neck. Avoid approaching objects that may cause harm, such as unstable items, windows, and mirrors. Secondly, stay calm and try to maintain a crouching or lying-down position to reduce the risk of injury. After the earthquake ends, carefully check if the surroundings are safe, avoid the impact of aftershocks, call for rescue personnel, and evacuate to a designated location according to the emergency plan.</p>

            <p>Through the above earthquake indoor safety and evacuation techniques, it is hoped that readers can enhance their self-rescue capabilities during earthquakes, ensuring the safety of themselves and their families.</p>
