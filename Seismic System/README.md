Introduction to the Functionality of the Earthquake Disaster Emergency Response System
Functional Description
Regarding the functionality of the system, currently, some features can only be used on a local computer.Therefore, we have provided videos in the documentation to demonstrate these features to the public.
Data Search Functionality
(1) You can use conditional search to select earthquake data within the desired range.
(2) You can view fault data.
(3) You can perform a conditional search to select information about buildings you want to see (such as schools, stations, etc.).

Data Visualization Functionality
(1) Heatmaps: We visually display the distribution of earthquakes to users through heatmaps.
(2) Spatial Search: Users can use a rectangle drawing button to outline the earthquake data within a specific area. Clicking on data points allows users to view information about the data.

Seismic Intensity Map Functionality
(1) This feature is currently under modification.
(2) Our main goal is to automatically generate seismic intensity maps based on user-input earthquake information. We will calculate the area of each intensity zone and the number of buildings within each zone.

Real-time Earthquake Information Reporting Functionality
(1) Real-time disaster information display: Users provide disaster information, and we present the user-submitted information in chart form.
(2) User information reporting: Users report information about the impact of the disaster and urgent material needs.
(3) One-click SOS function: Users can click a button, and the system will obtain the user's specific location and mark it on the map for rescue purposes.

Science Outreach
This section primarily provides users with knowledge about earthquakes, helping them understand earthquakes, how to self-rescue during earthquakes, and other information about earthquakes.
